    \class QDriveController
    \brief The QDriveController class provides an interface for drives in operating system.
    \reentrant

    QDriveController monitors appearing and disappearing of new drives and system and allows
    to mount and unmout filesystems. On most operating systems when user inserts flash drive
    or a cd-rom, it is automatically mounted to filesystem and you can monitor this events
    using this class.

    The driveMounted() signal is emitted when drive is mounted to filesystem - when user
    inserts cd-rom or adds new network drive.

    The driveUnmounted() signal is emitted when drive is unmounted from filesystem.
